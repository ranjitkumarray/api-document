                <h3>API Reference</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Clearbitâ€™s API! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Person API to look up email addresses, or the Company API to look up company information related to a domain name.</p>
                <p>The API is organized around REST. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.</p>
                <p> We also have some specific language bindings to make integration easier. You can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.</p>
                <p>Currently we support the following official client bindings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby</li>
                    <li>Node</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Go</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To play around with a few examples, we recommend a REST client called Postman. Simply tap the button below to import a pre-made collection of examples.</p>
