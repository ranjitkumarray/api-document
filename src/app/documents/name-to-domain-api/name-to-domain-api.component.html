        <h3>Name To Domain API</h3>
        <p>The Company Name to Domain API lets you convert the exact name of a company to a website domain, and a logo.</p>
        <p>We match based on exact company name, and return the company with the most website traffic. It’s worth noting, that since a company name is not a unique identifier, you should be prepared for some inherent inaccuracy in the results.</p>
